            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>HAVING this Opportunity, I could not forbear giving you this Brief Account of a Signal Victory which Providence gave us over Five Sail of Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates. The full Relation would take up more Time, and more Paper (which is a ſcarce Commodity with us) than I can ſpare at preſent; but however, I doubt not but that you will take this Haſty Relation in good part.</p>
            <p>Upon the laſt day of <hi>October,</hi> 1686. being upon a Sunday Morning, we happen'd to meet with Five Sail of Ships (at a Place called St. <hi>Jago,</hi> where we uſually touch to take in Freſh Water, and Freſh Proviſions) who came up to us at firſt with <hi>French</hi> Colours, but they were ſoon changed into <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Colours, and one of them hoiſted up the Bloody Flag, which immediatly alarmed Us, and made Us put our ſelves into a Condition of Receiving them, and they as immediatly ſet upon Us; We loſt all our Boats, and were forced to throw
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:171095:2"/> Three Thouſand weight of Bread over-board, and ſeveral other things, that we might have Room enough to Play our Great Guns.</p>
            <p>For Five hours ſpace we had a very hot and ſharp Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Their Admiral and Vice-Admiral intended to have Boarded Us upon our Sides, and another upon our Stern; yet we ſaw none bold enough to dare to take poſſeſſion; for at the ſame time we had the luck to give them our Broad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, and likewiſe our Small-ſhot from our <hi>Forecaſtle, Poop, Quarters</hi> and <hi>Decks,</hi> which we ſhowred on them like Hail; till at laſt the Villains were forced to march off with the loſs of their <hi>Boult-ſprit, Fore-maſt</hi> and <hi>Mizen yard</hi> from thoſe Three Ships which attempted to have Boarded Us. We ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe their Aim was at the Money which we had in the Ship, which was Eighty two thouſand Pounds, beſides the Cargoe; and if they had taken Us, We ſhould have been worth to them Two hundred thouſand Pounds, beſides the Ship: We had One hundred and twenty Souldiers on Board of Us, which did Us a great deal of good Service. We had but one Souldier killed, and one Sea-man loſt his Arm, by name <hi>Francis Stephens</hi> (a Water-man that uſed to Ply at <hi>Puddle-dock</hi> Stairs,) and we had about ſeven more woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; but we are certain that they have loſt ſeveral of their Men, beſides a great deal of damage done to their Shipping; for at laſt they were forced to fall a Stern to make good the damage they had received from Us, which queſtionleſs was very conſiderable; They were Ships of Burthen, and could not have leſs than between Twenty and Thirty Guns a-piece, and a great many Men on Board, of which they carried but few away. If I had had leiſure, I ſhould have given you a Fuller and more Particular Account: but this is in Subſtance the truth of the Action, in which I was engaged, who am</p>
